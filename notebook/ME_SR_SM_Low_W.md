# PopID: ME_SR_SM_Low_W

## Map:

Lat/long for this population is exact; Lat/long for Sheepscot is not listed by Erin but is in the datafile so I assume it is exact; Lat/long for USGS Sheepscot River are exact.

## Summary notes:

**Temp: combine from 2 sources: Robledo Sheepscot and USGS Sheepscot River station (all years).**

- The overall data range is 1991-2017 and the datas sources overlap in 2010-2015.
- Data frequency for these sources are different: Sheepscot (Robledo source) is monthly with several months missing, and USGS Sheepscot River is every 15 minutes.
- A few years are missing winter data.

**Sal: we decided to use NA because the bouys were not close to the site; bAsed on location this is probably a low/med site.**
