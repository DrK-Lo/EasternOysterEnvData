# PopID: NC_PC_CH_Low_W

## Map:

Lat/long for this population are exact; 

Lat/long for the datasource (same for temp and sal) are also exact.

## Summary notes:

Temp: combined USGS Croatan (station ID: 0208117950) all yrs and NOAA Orin7 all yrs.

Sal: use USGS Croatan station (ID: 0208117950) all years.

USGS data
- only using data flagged as "A" (approved); all data were "A" for the Croatan station but there were some blips that I deleted; 
- data range 1990-93; data given as daily max, min and mean. Elevation = 5 for temp and 10 for salinity (I don't know what that means). 
- some months are missing data.

NOAA data 
- data range 2005-19; data given as 9 readings per hour which was too much for excel to handle so I extracted hourly data.

To make the combined spreadsheet, I copied and pasted the hourly data from Orin7 under the columns max, mean and min from USGS.
