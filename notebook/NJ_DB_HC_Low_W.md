# PopID: NJ_DB_HC_Low_W

## Map:

Unclear from Erin's notes if lat/long for population are exact or approximate as there are no notes.

Lat/long for NOAA datasource (Ship J Shoal) are exact; lat/long for URI data not available, not in the map.

## Summary notes:

- Temp: I compared primary source (URI) with Ship J Shoal (cleaned up a bit, see notes on 2020-10-16 entry) (see KEL and TB notes from meeting on 2020-10-29) and combined them in the Summary table presented below; URI data given at 30 min intervals Jun 2012-Nov2015 & Ship J Shoal data given hourly, Jan 2002-Nov2019. 

> Two datasources overlap Jun 2012-Nov 2015, URI is missing winters.

- Sal: Primary source only, data available is conductivity, I calculated salinity from conductivity and temperature. Data given in 30 min intervals, May 2013-Nov2015, missing winters.

> Sal: from the 2020-10-29 meeting notes, I understood we should use the salinity calculated from conductivity data from the primary source (URI) - this is what is presented in the Summary table below. Let me know if I misunderstood the meeting notes, and if I was supposed to compare/combine salinity URI with salinity Ship J Shoal instead.

## Data source and filename:

Website: https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8537121 (Ship J Shoal, temp only); NA for primary source URI temp and sal.

Temp: NJ_DB_HC_Low_Temp.xlsx

Sal: NJ_DB_HC_Low_Sal.xlsx

## Plots: all data over time and data availability per month per year (this helps visualize the 'missing winter' question and other gaps in data) (simple plots made in excel).
