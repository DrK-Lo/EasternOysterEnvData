**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, USGS station 8017118 is the only datasource listed for both temperature and salinity.

I'm using an updated version (data range: 1998-2020) of the file originally provided by Erin (data range: 1999-2016).

**BEST DATASETS** - these are daily max, daily min and daily mean datasets.

Notes: 

**Data from 1998 starts in October (not a whole year) - should we exclude partial years?**

**Approved-filtered** - "Data-value qualification codes included in this output: ***  Value unavailable; A  Approved for publication -- Processing and review completed; P  Provisional data subject to revision (from provider)"
*I excluded lines without data (value unavailable) and provisional data subject to revision to create the "Approved-filtered column".*
