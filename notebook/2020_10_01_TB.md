**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, USGS station 8017118 is the only datasource listed for both temperature and salinity.

I'm using an updated version (data range: 1998-2020) of the file originally provided by Erin (data range: 1999-2016).

**BEST DATASETS** - these are daily max, daily min and daily mean datasets.

Notes: 

**Whole-yrs only** - range is 1999-2019. 2020 is excluded as we are in October and dataset started in Oct 1998, so all data from 1998 is excluded.

**Whole-yrs only** - range is 2003-2019 (less data for salinity than temperature in this USGS station). 2020 is excluded as we are in October and dataset started in Oct 2002, so all data from 2002 is excluded. 

**Flag-filtered** - For USGS: "Data-value qualification codes included in this output: ***  Value unavailable; A  Approved for publication -- Processing and review completed; P  Provisional data subject to revision (from provider)"
