**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, Steph Tobash Horn Poing data 1997-2020 HPLOH Sal and Temp.xlsl is the only datasource listed for both temperature and salinity.

Erin's note says: "April to December" but there's some data for January-March, too (see plot below showing datapoints per month in each year) (data range: 1997-2020). Winters are clearly under-represented which may bias temperature means.

**BEST DATASETS** - these are daily readings (or less frenquent) at random times (I wouldn't say they are daily means).

## PopID: MD_CB_CP_Low_W Temperature - filtration steps to clean dataset

> There was no data quality control in this file, and units are assumed (C and ppt/psu). I deleted two dates, one that was "0" for salinity and temperature and one that had duplicated values on the same day for both salinity and temperature.
> I eliminated the most incomplete years incrementaly to see how the lower frequency of "winter data" affected the means.
