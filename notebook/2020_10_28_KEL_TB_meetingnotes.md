## KEL thoughts on initial analysis
- it would be nice to have separate files for each site/population in the notebook entry title. We should talk about making edits to individual posts (which I'm fine with) vs. making new chronological posts. **DONE. I made notes based on our meeting on top of each YYYY_MM_DD_TB post to reflect/summarize what was decided in our meeting; those notes start with 'YYYY_MM_DD Thais's notes following meeting'. Then I made one new post per population named as each POP ID with the 'final' data for each population and some plots. So, the 'YYYY_MM_DD_TB posts' have all the 'history' of environmental data selection for each population, some of these posts have more than one pop; and the 'POP ID posts' have only what was selected as good environmental data for each POP plus some plots for easy/quick visualization of these data; all POP ID posts have a single POP per post.(TB)**

- let's make sure to put NA's in any calculation that is clearly bad or biased (e.g. calculating degree days when less than 365 days in data) **We decided to drop these measurements altogether**
  - degree days in general seems biased in most places. should we drop it? it seems very few have measured dd below 0. I'm wondering if we should increase it to ddb5 to make it a more meaningful metric. **We decided to drop these measurements altogether**
  - we discussed this and decided to drop this **DONE (TB)**

- in each report table it would be good to add :
  - the frequency of observations (e.g. hourly, daily) in addition to the number of years **DONE (TB)**
  - maybe we should add a column for whether the data is missing winter? **DONE but this is not super straightforward - for some datasets we are missing some winter data but not all - this has been noted in the "Summary table" based on "Summary notes" for each population (TB)**
- in some cases we should pool all the data together. **DONE; populations for which more than one environmental datasource is available and good, I pooled the data. Data pooling is indicated in the heading of "Summary table" - there is one summary table per population (TB)***
