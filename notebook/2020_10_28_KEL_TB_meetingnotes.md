## KEL thoughts on initial analysis
- it would be nice to have separate files for each site/population in the notebook entry title. We should talk about making edits to individual posts (which I'm fine with) vs. making new chronological posts.

- let's make sure to put NA's in any calculation that is clearly bad or biased (e.g. calculating degree days when less than 365 days in data)
  - degree days in general seems biased in most places. should we drop it? it seems very few have measured dd below 0. I'm wondering if we should increase it to ddb5 to make it a more meaningful metric.
  - we discussed this and decided to drop this

- in each report table it would be good to add :
  - the frequency of observations (e.g. hourly, daily) in addition to the number of years
  - maybe we should add a column for whether the data is missing winter?
- in some cases we should pool all the data together.
