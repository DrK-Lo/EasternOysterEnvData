**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, USGS station 07381349 is the only datasource listed for both temperature and salinity.

I'm using an updated version (data range: 1997-2020) of the file originally provided by Erin (data range: 2002-2016).

**BEST DATASETS** - these are daily max, daily min and daily mean datasets.

**Whole-yrs only** - original range: 1997-2020; years excluded 1997, 2000, 2001, 2017, 2020 (based on data map below).
