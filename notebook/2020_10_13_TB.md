## KEL and TB meeting notes

TO DO:

Temp
- Use all years - it looks like there is a "blip" in the temp data after 2005 - we should remove those for calculation

Salinity
- I think there is an issue with the salinity plot because the mean of 14ppt does not match the plot
- Use NA since we don't have a good salinity data for this site, "Med" based on info from Ximing
- Make a list of sites we are missing good salinity data for; maybe we can still find some

**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, the files inside of a folder named NOAA_8536110_Cape_May_NJ are the only datasource found for both temperature and salinity. One of the spreadsheets mentions a second source for temperature "Rutgers data: https://hsrl.rutgers.edu/HSRL%20documents/Water%20Temperature/index.temperature.html" but Erin's note says Rutgers sites need to be investigated for proximity to the oyster site (Check with Katie).

> Note from Erin "Ximing says Cape May buoy is not a good representation of salinity data here, Ship John Shoals not a good represenation". I plotted anyways but if we are to follow this note, there is no salinity data available for this population. -----> **this does not make sense given the lat and long given for the population and Cape May, so check with Katie.**

Erin's note says: "data in 15 min increments" but data are in hourly increments (see plot below showing datapoints per month in each year.
Data range temperature: 1997-2020, but missing 2015 and patch in some years.
Data range conductivity (salinity): 2019-2020


**BEST DATASETS** - these are hourly readings (i.e., up to 24 readings per day).

## PopID: NJ_DB_CS_Med_W Temperature - filtration steps to clean dataset

> There was no data quality control in this file; units not provided in Erin's files but I went to the source and downloaded the data again, with units.
> Temperature in Celsius and conductivity in mS/cm; I converted conductivity into salinity using http://salinometry.com/pss-78/

Plot showing data distribution by year and month for **temperature**- the numbers inside the boxes are the number of datapoints per month in each year, at an hourly resolution. Full datasets = 744 (for months with 31d x 24h), 720 (for months with 30d x 24h), 696 or 672 (for February, leap 29d x 24h; and reg years 28d x 24h). This is to see if there are any 'holes' in the dataset (missing too many winters or summers, etc) that could bias the calculated means in the table below - this bias would be more relevant for temperature than for salinity, given the seasonality of temperature.

> Based on the plot above, I eliminated the most incomplete years to see how the lower frequency of "winter data" affected the means.

### Note from Erin "Ximing says Cape May buoy is not a good representation of salinity data here, Ship John Shoals not a good represenation". I plotted anyways but if we are to follow this note, there is no salinity data available for this population.

Plot showing data distribution by year and month for **salinity** - given we only have 2 years worth of data and seasonality is less likely to affect salinity, I kept all the data and filtered only for zeros (missing data).
