# PopID: NJ_DB_CS_Med_W

## Map:

It is unclear to me whether the lat/long for the these populations are exact or not. Here is Erin's note on NJ_DB_CS_Med_W: *This is a reef that is at the Cape Shore Selected Rutgers NEH farm site. So althought they are considered "wild", we may not want to consider them wild for analysis. Salinity 18-22 (Ximing)*. 

Lat/long for datasources are exact.

## Summary notes:

- NOAA Cape May station ID 8536110 is ok for temperature, but not for salinity according to Ximing.
- 2005 temperature blip has been fixed (removed data from 4-7 Jul); I also cleaned up a few odd datapoints and excluded 2016, which only had data for 1 week in June. Other than that, this file has not quality control or flags from provider.
- no salinity data for this population.

## KEL and TB meeting notes

TO DO:

Temp
- Use all years - it looks like there is a "blip" in the temp data after 2005 - we should remove those for calculation DONE, also removed 2016 (TB)

Salinity
- I think there is an issue with the salinity plot because the mean of 14ppt does not match the plot FIXED, I typed the data from the wrong column (TB)
- Use NA since we don't have a good salinity data for this site, "Med" based on info from Ximing DONE (TB)
- Make a list of sites we are missing good salinity data for; maybe we can still find some NOT DONE YET

**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, the files inside of a folder named NOAA_8536110_Cape_May_NJ are the only datasource found for both temperature and salinity. One of the spreadsheets mentions a second source for temperature "Rutgers data: https://hsrl.rutgers.edu/HSRL%20documents/Water%20Temperature/index.temperature.html" but Erin's note says Rutgers sites need to be investigated for proximity to the oyster site (Check with Katie).

> Note from Erin "Ximing says Cape May buoy is not a good representation of salinity data here, Ship John Shoals not a good represenation". I plotted anyways but if we are to follow this note, there is no salinity data available for this population. -----> **this does not make sense given the lat and long given for the population and Cape May, so check with Katie.**

Erin's note says: "data in 15 min increments" but data are in hourly increments (see plot below showing datapoints per month in each year).
Data range temperature: 1997-2020, but missing 2015 and patch in some years.
Data range conductivity (salinity): 2019-2020


**BEST DATASETS** - these are hourly readings (i.e., up to 24 readings per day).

## PopID: NJ_DB_CS_Med_W Temperature - filtration steps to clean dataset

> There was no data quality control in this file; units not provided in Erin's files but I went to the source and downloaded the data again, with units.
> Temperature in Celsius and conductivity in mS/cm; I converted conductivity into salinity using http://salinometry.com/pss-78/

Plot showing data distribution by year and month for **temperature**- the numbers inside the boxes are the number of datapoints per month in each year, at an hourly resolution. Full datasets = 744 (for months with 31d x 24h), 720 (for months with 30d x 24h), 696 or 672 (for February, leap 29d x 24h; and reg years 28d x 24h). This is to see if there are any 'holes' in the dataset (missing too many winters or summers, etc) that could bias the calculated means in the table below - this bias would be more relevant for temperature than for salinity, given the seasonality of temperature.

> Based on the plot above, I eliminated the most incomplete years to see how the lower frequency of "winter data" affected the means.

### Note from Erin "Ximing says Cape May buoy is not a good representation of salinity data here, Ship John Shoals not a good represenation". I plotted anyways but if we are to follow this note, there is no salinity data available for this population.

Plot showing data distribution by year and month for **salinity** - given we only have 2 years worth of data and seasonality is less likely to affect salinity, I kept all the data and filtered only for zeros (missing data).
