# PopID: NJ_DB_CS_Med_W

## Map:

It is unclear to me whether the lat/long for this population are exact or approximate. Erin/Dina's note: *This is a reef that is at the Cape Shore Selected Rutgers NEH farm site. So althought they are considered "wild", we may not want to consider them wild for analysis. Salinity 18-22 (Ximing)*. 

Lat/long for datasources are exact.

## Summary notes:

- NOAA Tides & Currents Station ID Cape May #8536110 is ok for temperature, but not for salinity according to Ximing.
  - 2005 temperature blip has been fixed (removed data from 4-7 Jul); I also cleaned up a few odd datapoints and excluded 2016, which only had data for 1 week in June. Other than that, this file has not quality control or flags from provider and has chunks of data missing (see table and plot below).
- no salinity data for this population.
