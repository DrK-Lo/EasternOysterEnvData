## Map:

Lat/long for this population is exact; 

Lat/long for Hog Island is not listed by Erin but is in the datafile so I assume it is exact; 

Lat/long for Upper Damaricotta and dockdata are listed by Erin but does not say if exact or approximate.

## Summary notes:

**Temp: combine from 3 sources: Hog Island (3 stations, pre-combined), Upper Damariscotta and DockData (all years).**

**Sal: combine from 2 sources: Hog Island (3 stations, pre-combined) and Upper Damaricotta (all years - KEL notes says 'Hog Island whole years', but I think it's a typo and I used all years).**

- The overall data range is 1990-2020 and the datas sources overlap in 2015-2016.
- Data frequency is different for each source: monthly for Hog Island, hourly for Upper Damariscotta and multiple times (but not daily or weekly) per month for DockData.
- Many but not all winter months are missing.

(see details on each source in entry dated 2020-10-20)
