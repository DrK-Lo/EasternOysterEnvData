## Select best temperature and salinity datasets for each popularion.

**Step 1)** For each WILD population (popID ending in _W) that have primary and secondary datasources listed in EasternOysterSeascapeData, compare primary and secondary datasets when secondary source would be preferable (more data, higher resolution, etc). 

> This is to see if data in primary and secondary sources for the same timeframe are similar enough. 
> If they are similar enough, that means the secondary dataset can be used instead of the primary dataset to represent temperature/salinity experienced by that particular population.
> If they are too different (more likely to happen for salinity - more spaciously heterogeneous than temperature) - stick with the primary source.

**Step 2)** For the timeframe that will be compared, filter out bad data according to the data provider's instructions. Compare common and clean data.

> At the end of this step, we will have selected the best temperature and salinity dataset for each population. 

**Step 3)** Using the best dataset for each population, filter the entire daataset, plot the data and calculate: N_all, Average_all, StdDev_all, Max_all, Min_all, N_years, Mean_Max_years, Mean_Min_years, dd_00 (number of days temp below 0oC), dd_15 (number of days temp above 15oC) and dd_30 (number of days temp above 30oC). If possible, plot and calculate data for each step of filtration to see how data filtration affect those parameters.


# PopID: VA_CB_HC_Med_W

**Primary datasource:** VIMS_Sonde_Marker_119 (Apr-Oct, missing Aug, every 15min).

**Secondary datasource:** NERR CBVGIWQ (1997-2020, every 15min).

Steps to compare primary and secondary datasources (this is done for Temperature and Salinity separately):

1) "Align" the large NERR and small VIMS datasets to end up with a timeframe for which we have data available from both stations. 

2) Clean up the large NERR dataset based on the flags/flag codes, historical and provisional flags. VIMS data did not come with quality control info.

3) Clean up the small VIMS dataset if needed to end up with exact matching dates on both datasets.

4) The common_and_clean datasets from each source are compared based on N, average, stddev, min and max (using pivot tables).
