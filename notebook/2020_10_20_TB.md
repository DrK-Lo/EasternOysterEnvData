ME High and Low populations are being treated together do decide best datasources.

This map includes population locations, all the datasources listed for both temperature and salinity, and an USGS station I found nearby (temp only). All locations are labelled but population lat and long are marked as "P".

# ME_DR_HI_High_W - Temperature

**Primary**

Jose Antonio Hog Island Buoy (Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx)
* Erin's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data readings once per month Jan.- Nov. 1990-2016. 
* Thais's notes (after looking at the file): Temperature in celsius. 1990-2016. This file has data for 3 locations: HogIsland, Sheepscot and Lewis. This is the best datasouce because Hog Island is very close to the population location. Monthly readings **but readings for several months are missing for most years; HogIsland does have a few years with data for all months**. Sheepscot is close enough that it could be ok for temperature, but not as good as HogIsland and none but 2 years have data for all months.
