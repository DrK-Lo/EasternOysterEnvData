ME High and Low populations are being treated together do decide best datasources.

This map includes population locations, all the datasources listed for both temperature and salinity, and an USGS station I found nearby (temp only). All locations are labelled and population lat and long are marked as "P" to make it easier to find their location relative to the datasources locations.

# ME_DR_HI_High_W - Temperature

**Primary**

Jose Antonio Hog Island Buoy (Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx)
* Erin's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data readings once per month Jan.- Nov. 1990-2016. 
* Thais's notes (after looking at the file): Temperature in celsius. 1990-2016. This file has data for 3 locations: Hog Island, Sheepscot and Lewis. **Monthly readings and readings for several months are missing for most years; HogIsland does have 3 whole years (st 1 2002 and 2004, st 2 2004)**. This is the best datasouce location-wise because Hog Island is very close to the population location. Sheepscot is close enough that it could be ok for temperature, but not as good as HogIsland, and no whole years. Lewis is far away, towards the ocean and no whole years. *I'm not using Sheepscot or Lewis for temperature*.


Damian Brady Darling Marine Center (LOBO_Data_Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE.xlsx)
* Erin's notes: LOBO data has both temperature and salinity from Upper Damariscotta from April-Nov for 2015-2019.
* Thais's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data frequencies and ranges for each year are: hourly, Sept-Nov 2015; hourly, Apr-Nov 2016; hourly, Jun-Nov 2017; hourly Apr-Nov 2018; no data for 2019. this looks like a good datasource location-wise, but all years are missing several months, mostly cold months. **Might need to be compared to Hog Island data to capture colder months.**

UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt
* Erin's notes: hints that this file is the same as the LOBO file.
* Thais's notes: this file has the same data as the LOBO file **plus 2019 data: hourly, Jul-Nov 2019**. The file has also been cleaned out of other data (turbidity, nutrients, etc) so it is like a summary file. The lat/long for this location is the exact same as the LOBO location.

Bar Harbour Bouy, Upper Damariscotta LOBO (data_dock.csv)

LOBO_Data_Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE.xlsx - this file is listed as primary and other, so same notes as above.

UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt - this file is listed as primary and other, so same notes as above.

Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx
* Erin's notes: no notes.
* Thais's notes: Salinity in pct? I'm assuming them meant ppt. 1990-2016. This file has data for 3 locations: Hog Island, Sheepscot and Lewis. **Monthly readings and readings for several months are missing for most years; HogIsland does have 10 whole years (st1 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2004, st2 2002 and 2004, st3 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2004)**. This is the best datasouce location-wise because Hog Island is very close to the population location. Sheepscot is close enough that it could be ok for temperature, but not as good as HogIsland, and 2 whole years (st3 2000 and 2004). Lewis is far away, towards the ocean and no whole years. *I'm not using Lewis for temperature, but maybe Sheepscot*.
