## COMPARE SOURCES
> The only datasource listed for this population for both temperature and salinity is UNCW_CORMP_CMSDOCK_station, so nothing to compare to.

## PopID: NC_WI_HC_XXX_W - Temperature
* Erin's notes: Temperature in Celsius, data in 15 minute increments. 2018-2020. Jan-Nov.	
* Thais's notes: Temp in Celsius, data in 15 min increments. 2018 (Nov-Dec), 2019 (Jan-Dec), 2020 (Jan-Oct) - this is an active station so data is likely to be continuously added. Quality control not included, file says "quality not evaluated". I deleted the first day of data that seemed off (9-Nov-2018), all zeros and all -6999 (probably code for missing data).

# PopID: NC_PC_CH_XXX_W

## COMPARE SOURCES

Temperature: comparing USGS_0208117950_croatan and NOAA data buoy center Oregon Inlet 8652587. The time frame for these two datasources does not overlap, so I will plot them separately and compare them in the summary table.

Salinity: only datasource listed is USGS_0208117950_croatan, so nothing to compare.

## PopID: NC_PC_CH_XXX_W - Temperature
* Erin's notes: Croatan Temperature in Celsius, data given as daily mean, max, and min. 1990-1993. Measured elevation 5.00. Oregon inlet temperature in celsius from 2005-2019. 9 readings per hour, January-Dec.
* Thais's notes: Croatan Temperature in Celsius, data given as daily mean, max, and min (but some days/months are missing). 1990-1993. Measured elevation 5.00 - using this as elevation = 10 is not available (see salinity data from USGS Croatan). Oregon inlet temperature in celsius from 2005-2019. 9 readings per hour from 2007 to 2019, January-Dec. This resolution of 9 readins per hour is too high and it is making it difficult to manage that much data. I am keeping one measurement per hour. 


## PopID: NC_PC_CH_XXX_W - Salinity
* Erin's notes: Salinity in ppt, data given as daily mean, max, and min. 1990-1993. Measured elevation 5.00
* Thais's notes: Salinity in ppt, data given as daily mean, max, and min (but some days/months are missing). 1990-1993. Data given for elevation 5 and 10 (I don't know what that means - I chose elevation = 10 for salinity because there are ~30% more data available; overall average slighly higher for elevation 10 compared to elevation 5 but both are low). Quality control/flags are applied to this datafile but all are approved, so no filtration needed).
