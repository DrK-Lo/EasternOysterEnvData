# NY_LI_LH_High_W

## Map:

Lat/long for this population - unclear whether exact or approximate; Erin's note says "farmer collected samples". Lat/long for datasources are exact.

## Summary notes:

Temp: datasource is NOAA "National data Buoy center 44040 Western Long Island Sound"; temperature data available for years 2004 and 2005 (confirmed by checking the source website); 2004 is missing Oct9-Dec14; 2005 is missing Nov10-Dec31.

Sal: data source is "Save the Sound" https://www.savethesound.org/water-monitoring-ecological-health 2018_UWS_Data.xlsx; I believe they requested the datafile over email because I don't see a place to download data on the website. Data available May-Oct 2018, two readings per month.

Our meeting notes are confusing me re salinity - it says to label this site as "High" but also that we did not trust the salinity data and should call it NA. I did both but seems contradictory now, **ask Katie**.

# NY_LI_CM_High_W

## Map:

Lat/long for this population is probably approximate, Erin's note says "give a site on land". Lat/long for datasources are exact (and the same as for NY_LI_LH_High_W).

## Summary notes:

Environmental data for this population are exactly the same as for population NY_LI_LH_High_W; so summary notes are the same.

# KEL notes
- KEL and TB talked about the max/min given sparse data, we decided temp is ok, but salinity should be NA
  - We decided this was a "High" site
  - We removed dd calculations b/c unreliable
- TO DO: Add number of months as fraction
  - Change data names to "High" in other data sheets
  - Add data_range (years) and frequency

# Map of populations (marked with a P) and datasource locations:

https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1paClfxbz7rbNH6Dyh37e8K_XS2DTiXeY&usp=sharing

> NY locations are not defined as High, Med or Low. 

> Lat/long for location NY_LI_CM_XXX_W give a site on land.

> The same temperature and salinity primary datasources are listed for both locations, without alternative sources. 


## COMPARE SOURCES
> Temperature datasource listed for these two populations is a NOAA buoy "National data Buoy center 44040 Western Long Island Sound"; Salinity datasource listed for both populations is Save the Sound, https://www.savethesound.org/water-monitoring-ecological-health, 2018_UWS_Data.xlsx.

> That means no datasources to compare. 

# PopID: NY_LI_LH_XXX_W and NY_LI_CM_XXX_W - Temperature
* Erin's notes: NBDC buoy Historical data is available for this buoy from 2004 to 2019. Includes temperature but not salinity. Data is from Jan-Dec.
* Thais's notes: NBDC files only show temperature data for years 2004 and 2005. Other data available 2006-19, but not temperature (nor salinity). Confirmed by checking the source website. 2004 is missing Oct9-Dec14; 2005 is missing Nov10-Dec31 **Should I look for a new location to replace this? (ask Katie)**
