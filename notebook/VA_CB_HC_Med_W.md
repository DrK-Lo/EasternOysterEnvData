## Pop ID: VA_CB_HC_High_W

## Map:

Lat/long for population is approximate, this is Erin's note on it: *APPROXIMATE- picture of the sampling site on a map was provided by Jess. Lat and Long approximate by Erin on google maps using this. I checked it today and got a slightly more accurate number based on the map provided.*
Lat/long for environmental data temp is exact and for sal it is the same as the population's lat/long.

## Summary notes:

NERR_CBVGIWQ is ok for temperature but not for salinity; temp data has been flag-filtered (this eliminates data that didn't pass quality control by the provider).

VIMS_Sonde_Marker_119 is ok for salinity; sal data has not been through any quality control.

## Data source and filenames:

Website: http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/dges/ (temperature only); NA for salinity.

Temp: VA_CB_HC_High_W_Temp.xlsx

Sal: VA_CB_HC_High_W_Sal.xlsx

## Plots: all data over time and data availability per month per year (this helps visualize the 'missing winter' question and other gaps in data) (simple plots made in excel).
