# Pop ID: LA_CL_SL_Low_W

## Map:

Lat/long for population is unknown so using lat/long of data sources, which are exact. Erin/Dina's note: *APPROXIMATE-none provided by sampler, taken from USGS buoy 07381349 (where env data was collected)*

## Summary notes:

USGS Station ID Sister Lake 07381349 is ok for temperature and salinity; both temp and sal data have been flag-filtered to include approved "A" data and exclude provisional "P" data (this eliminates data that didn't pass quality control by the provider, or hasn't yet been through QC).

Data is given as Daily Mean, Max and Min; in the Summary Table below:

- Mean_all and StdDev_all were calculated from Daily Means,
- Mean and StdDev yearly_max were calculated from Daily Maxs,
- Mean and StdDev yearly_min were calculated from Daily Mins.
