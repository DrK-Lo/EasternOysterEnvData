## Select best temperature and salinity datasets for each popularion.

For each WILD population in EasternOysterSeascapeData (popID ending in _W), compare primary and secondary data sources when secondary source would be preferable (more data, higher resolution, etc). 

> This is to see data in primary and secondary sources for the same timeframe are similar enough. 
> If they are similar enough, that means the secondary dataset can be used instead of the primary dataset to represent temperature/salinity in that location.

For example: 

# PopID: VA_CB_HC_Med_W

**Primary datasource:** VIMS_Sonde_Marker_119 (Apr-Oct, missing Aug, every 15min)

**Secondary datasource:** NERR CBVGIWQ (1997-2020, every 15min)

> VIMS data: not subject to quality control; NERR data is filtered before comparing with VIMS data. 

Steps to compare primary and secondary datasources (this is done for Temperature and Salinity separately):

1) "Align" the large NERR and small VIMS datasets to end up with a timeframe for which we have data available from both stations. 

2) Clean up the large NERR dataset based on the flags/flag codes, historical and provisional flags.

3) Clean up the small VIMS dataset if needed to end up with exact matching dates on each dataset.

4) The common_and_clean datasets from each source are compared based on N, average, stddev, min and max (using pivot tables).
